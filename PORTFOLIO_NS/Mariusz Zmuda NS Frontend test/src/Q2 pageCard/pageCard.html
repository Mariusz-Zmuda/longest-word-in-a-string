<!-- My built card using a placeholder image from: https://place-hold.it/ 
Fonts were not given, but I tried to keep the same number of words per lines, padding and roughly the same proportions of the original card. I slightly increased colour contrast to make the price and the text under the heading more visible for vision-impaired people. -->
